# web-curriculum

What is the goal?

Welcome to our front-end code challenge.

• Your general knowledge on how to work with React and TypeScript.
• Your ability to build reusable, easy-to-understand code.
• How well do you know and follow best development practices and established patterns.

The exercise

For this challenge, we suggest the creation of a web-based curriculum vitae for you to show us, in practice, the extent of your knowledge and abilities.

Design Constraints

The curriculum can, and should, follow any design you deem appropriate. However, consider a few constraints:
• It should have at least two different pages, so we can see how you understand and deal with routing on a React application.
• It should have a header and footer that remains the same on every page, so we can see how you manage components that are reused within multiple routes.
• The header and footer should both contain a button that toggles dark mode. When this mode is active, the button should visibly change, and every component should have its style adjusted to have visibly darker colors so that we can see how you deal with state and global state.
• Each of your work and academic experiences should be accompanied by a timer that shows how long ago it started. This timer should count the years, hours, and minutes so that we can see how you deal with timed re-renders on a react component using its state and hooks.

Technical Constraints

The project should be developed using React, TypeScript, and a CSS preprocessor of your choice. As long as you use this tech stack, feel free to create the project in any way you see fit. We encourage you to show us a solution with clean code that anyone versed in React could easily understand. The React components should be reusable, using modern patterns, such as hooks, whenever applicable. And the file/folder structure and naming should be coherent and clearly describe your solution’s architecture.
